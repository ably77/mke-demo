# Setup Script for Two K8s Clusters on DC/OS ("2k8s")
Revision 2-2-19

This is a script for Enterprise DC/OS 1.12 that will setup two Kubernetes clusters with L4/L7 Ingress, Gitlab, Jenkins, a Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack, and a Kafka monitoring demonstration  

This script has only been tested on OSX with DC/OS >1.12.0 Enterprise Edition  

In the order below, this script will:

1. Move existing DC/OS clusters into /tmp/dcos-clusters and set up a new cluster URL provided

2. Update $LICENSE_FILE if it exists in the optional variables section if it exists

3. Do an ssh-add on the $SSH_KEY_FILE in the optional variables section if it exists

4. Move existing kube config to /tmp/kubectl-config so we can set up a new kube config

5. Add repo and install Edge-LB - deploy kubectl pool once completed

6. Set up Service Accounts and Install MKE Kubernetes engine

7. Set up Service Accounts and Install /prod/kubernetes-prod cluster
- HA Deployment (3x etcd / 3x control-plane), 3 private nodes, RBAC enabled, control plane CPU lowered to 0.5, private reserved resources kube cpus lowered to 1     

8. Set up Service Accounts and Install /dev/kubernetes-dev cluster
- Non-HA deployment, 1 private node, control plane CPU lowered to 0.5, private reserved resources kube cpus lowered to 1  

9. Install Jenkins in /dev/jenkins

10. Install Gitlab in /prod/gitlab-prod and /dev/gitlab-dev, expose gitlab-prod and gitlab-dev on your EDGELB_PUBLIC_AGENT_IP:<10006/10007>

11. Install Kafka - Create a topic called performancetest

12. Wait for Kubernetes to complete deployment and connect clusters /dev/kubernetes-dev and /prod/kubernetes-prod using kubectl

13. Deploy Kafka producer deployment `kafka-producer.yaml` on /prod/kubernetes-prod that sends data to Kafka

14. Install DKLB (beta) for L4/L7 Ingress on MKE

15. Multiple Hello World services, and multiple DC/OS Websites exposed on L4 and L7 through Edge-LB

16. Create a prod-user in the prod group and a dev-user in the dev group both with the default DC/OS password

17. Install dcos-monitoring and open up Grafana dashboard

18. Open up Gitlab, L4 and L7 services in your browser

## PREREQUISITES

1. The DC/OS CLI and kubectl must already be installed on your local machine

You can install the DC/OS CLI for Mac OSX below:
```
[ -d /usr/local/bin ] || sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin &&
curl https://downloads.dcos.io/binaries/cli/darwin/x86-64/dcos-1.12/dcos -o dcos &&
sudo mv dcos /usr/local/bin &&
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dcos
```

2. Ensure that ports 6443 and 6444 are not blocked by firewall rules (optional 81,82,10000-10005 as well if you want to see the Kubernetes exposed services in your browser)

## SETUP

1. Clone this repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/ably77/mke-demo.git`  
   `cd mke-demo`

2. Optional: Modify the variables section in the `runme.sh`

#### USAGE

1. Start a cluster, such as in CCM or TF. Minimum of 9 private agents (m4.xlarge) or 5 private agents (m4.2xlarge), only 1 public agent, DC/OS EE 1.12

2. Ensure that Port 6443/6444 are at minimum open to your local machine (optional 81,82,10000-10005 as well if you want to see the Kubernetes exposed services in your browser)

3. Copy the master's URL to your clipboard. If it begins with HTTP the script will change it to HTTPS.

4. Modify the Variables section in the runme.sh

5. `sudo ./runme <MASTER_URL>`

6. Wait for it to finish (~ 10-12 min)
